## About me

Hi! I am Yuekun Yao, a Ph.D. student in computational linguistics at Saarland University working with [Alexander Koller](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/).

<!--My research interests focus on structured prediction tasks in natural language understanding, including syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and semantic parsing. Currently I am especially interested in using sequence-to-sequence models to learn compositional generalization, a key ability that humans use to generate infinate natural language sentences from finite grammar structures.-->

The main research question I am interested in is *How does NLP models generalize to unfamiliar data and how can we improve it?* I investigate **out-of-distribution generalization** with a focus on **compositional generalization** to bridge the gap between training and test distributions in realistic applications. I am also interested in **trustworthiness** of NLP models to detect their errors when deploying them to the wild. 
My work aims to both understand model behaviours and develop more effective and reliable NLP models through the following research questions.

- Can NLP models perform human-like generalization, and why? [[1]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.337/) How about LLMs? [[2]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.194/)
- How to improve models' compositional generalization ability with general-purpose models (seq2seq)? [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09815)
- How to build trustworthy models that generalize reliably? Can we train an one model (discriminator) to judge the outputs of another model (parser)? [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09422)
