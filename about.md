### About me
Hi! I am Yuekun Yao, a PhD student in computational linguistics at Saarland University working with Alexander Koller.

My research interests focus on structured prediction tasks in natural language understanding, including syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and semantic parsing. Currently I am especially interested in using sequence-to-sequence models to learn compositional generalization, a key ability that humans use to generate infinate natural language sentences from finite grammar structures.
