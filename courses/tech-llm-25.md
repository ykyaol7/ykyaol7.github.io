title: "Reasoning with LLMs (UdS; Summer25/26)"
---

### Course Description

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools capable of performing
a wide range of human-like tasks, from translation to complex problem-solving.
However, reasoning—the ability to logically infer, plan, 
and generalize—remains a fundamental challenge that distinguishes them 
from human intelligence. While techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting
and specialized training methods have improved structured reasoning, 
the extent of LLMs' true reasoning abilities is still uncertain. 
In this seminar, we will explore recent advancements in LLM reasoning, 
critically examine their strengths and limitations, 
and discuss the challenges in moving beyond pattern recognition toward 
more robust, human-like reasoning.

### Prerequisites

Students should have a solid background in NLP and machine learning. 
Familiarity with language models, including how tasks are defined, 
common architectures such as GPT-2, and how these models are trained
to perform specific tasks, will be assumed.
